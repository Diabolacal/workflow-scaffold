# Workspace Abstract

> A one-page overview of what this scaffold provides and how to start using it.

## What Is This?

This repository is a **workflow scaffold** — a reusable starting point for projects that use AI coding agents (GitHub Copilot, Claude, GPT, etc.) within VS Code. It contains:

- **Agent steering files** that guide AI assistants on conventions, guardrails, and operational rules
- **Working Memory protocol** for maintaining context across long sessions
- **Risk classification system** (Low/Medium/High) with approval tokens for sensitive changes
- **Decision logging** templates for recording architectural choices
- **VS Code configuration** tuned for agent-assisted workflows
- **Security guidelines** based on OWASP Top 10
- **Optional templates** for Cloudflare Pages/Workers deployment

## What It Is NOT

- Not a web framework or starter kit — there is no application code
- Not opinionated about language, framework, or cloud provider (except optional Cloudflare templates)
- Not a replacement for CI/CD — it complements your pipeline with agent-level guardrails

## How to Use

### Starting a New Project

1. Clone or copy this scaffold into your project directory
2. Search for `{{PLACEHOLDER}}` markers and replace with your project details
3. Fill in project-specific sections (architecture overview, key folders, high-risk surfaces)
4. Delete templates you don't need (e.g., `templates/cloudflare/` if not using Cloudflare)
5. Commit and begin development

### Key Placeholders to Replace

| Placeholder | Description | Example |
|---|---|---|
| `{{PROJECT_NAME}}` | Your project name | `my-saas-app` |
| `{{FRONTEND_DIR}}` | Frontend source directory | `web/`, `client/` |
| `{{FRONTEND_STACK}}` | Frontend technology | `React + TypeScript + Vite` |
| `{{BACKEND_DESCRIPTION}}` | Backend architecture | `Express API + PostgreSQL` |
| `{{DEPLOY_COMMAND}}` | Primary deploy command | `npm run deploy` |
| `{{PLATFORM_CLI}}` | Platform CLI tool | `wrangler`, `vercel`, `aws` |
| `{{SSH_ALIAS}}` | Server SSH shortcut | `ssh my-vps` |
| `{{HIGH_RISK_SURFACES}}` | Critical code areas | `src/auth/`, `migrations/` |
| `{{SMOKE_CHECKLIST}}` | Manual verification steps | `Login works, API responds` |

## Running Agents

Once placeholders are filled in, AI agents will automatically pick up:
- `AGENTS.md` — loaded by VS Code agent mode on every conversation
- `.github/copilot-instructions.md` — loaded by GitHub Copilot for repo-wide rules
- `.github/skills/` — available as invocable skills in Copilot Chat

No additional setup is needed beyond opening the project in VS Code with Copilot enabled.

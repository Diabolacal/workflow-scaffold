# Workflow Scaffold

A reusable, project-agnostic scaffold for AI-assisted development workflows in VS Code.

## What's Included

- **Agent steering system** — `AGENTS.md` + `.github/copilot-instructions.md` provide guardrails, conventions, and operational rules that AI coding agents automatically pick up
- **Working Memory protocol** — maintain context across long agent sessions and survive automatic summarization
- **Risk classification** — Low/Medium/High risk classes with approval token escalation for sensitive changes
- **Three-tier permission model** — Always do / Ask first / Never do boundaries for agent actions
- **Decision logging** — templates for recording architectural choices
- **Security guidelines** — OWASP-based secure coding practices
- **VS Code config** — settings and extensions tuned for agent workflows
- **Skills** — reusable agent skills for deployment and container operations
- **Cloudflare templates** (optional) — Pages/Workers configuration starters

## Quick Start

1. Copy this scaffold into your project (or use as a template repo)
2. Replace `{{PLACEHOLDER}}` markers with your project details — see [docs/SCAFFOLD_NOTES.md](docs/SCAFFOLD_NOTES.md)
3. Fill in architecture, commands, and high-risk surfaces in `.github/copilot-instructions.md`
4. Open in VS Code with Copilot enabled — agents automatically load the steering files
5. Start building

## File Structure

```
AGENTS.md                          ← Auto-loaded agent context (VS Code 1.104+)
GITHUB-COPILOT.md                  ← Copilot playbook
llms.txt                           ← AI-readable doc pointer
.github/
  copilot-instructions.md          ← Authoritative guardrails
  security-guidelines.md           ← OWASP security rules
  prompts/rehydrate.prompt.md      ← Context recovery prompt
  skills/deploy/SKILL.md           ← Deploy skill
  skills/docker-ops/SKILL.md       ← Container ops skill
.vscode/
  settings.json                    ← Agent settings
  extensions.json                  ← Recommended extensions

  DECISIONS_TEMPLATE.md            ← Decision log format
  COPILOT_MEMORY_GUIDELINES.md     ← Memory guidelines

  cloudflare/                      ← Optional CF config templates
```

## How It Works

VS Code 1.104+ automatically loads `AGENTS.md` into every Copilot agent conversation. GitHub Copilot also reads `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for repo-wide rules. Together, these files steer AI assistants to:

- Follow your project conventions
- Respect risk boundaries and approval workflows
- Run verification gates (typecheck, build, smoke tests)
- Log decisions and maintain context
- Execute CLI commands directly instead of asking you to run them

## Requirements

- VS Code 1.104+ (for `AGENTS.md` auto-loading)
- GitHub Copilot extension (recommended) or any VS Code-compatible AI agent
- No runtime dependencies — this scaffold contains only markdown, JSON, and configuration files
